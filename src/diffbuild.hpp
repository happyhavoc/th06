// Helpers to improve the diff quality of DIFFBUILDs.
//
// A DIFFBUILD is a build of the project made not to be run, but to be diffed
// against the original TH06 to find inaccuracies in our reimplementation. To
// make a DIFFBUILD, one must call the makefile with DIFFBUILD=1
//
// This helper provides two macros: DIFFABLE_EXTERN and DIFFABLE_STATIC. All
// static variables should be defined and declared through those macros. So for
// instance, instead of
//
// ```
// Stage g_Stage;
// ```
//
// One should write
//
// ```
// DIFFABLE_STATIC(Stage, g_Stage)
// ```
//
// The first argument is the type, while the second argument is the name of the
// static variable.
//
// When assigning to an array, the `DIFFABLE_STATIC_ARRAY_ASSIGN` macro should
// be used like this:
//
// ```
// DIFFABLE_STATIC_ARRAY_ASSIGN(u32, 5, g_ArrayName) = { 0, 1, 2 };
// ```
