This project aims to perfectly reconstruct the source code of [Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil 1.02h](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil) by Team Shanghai Alice.

**This project is still highly work in progress and in its early stages.**


## Installation

### Executable

This project requires the original `東方紅魔郷.exe` version 1.02h (9f76483c46256804792399296619c1274363c31cd8f1775fafb55106fb852245)

Copy `東方紅魔郷.exe` to `resources/game.exe`.

### Dependencies

The build system has the following package requirements:

- `python3` >= 3.4
- `msiextract` (On linux/macos only)
- `wine` (on linux/macos only, prefer CrossOver on macOS to avoid possible CL.EXE heap issues)

The rest of the build system is constructed out of Visual Studio 2002 and DirectX 8.0 from the Web Archive.

#### Configure devenv

Run the following script:
```bash
# NOTE: On macOS if you use CrossOver.
# export WINE=<CrossOverPath>/wine
./scripts/create_th06_prefix
```

#### Building

Run the following script:

```
python3 ./scripts/build.py
```

This will automatically generate a ninja build script `build.ninja`, and run
ninja on it.

## Reverse Engineering

You can find an XML export of our Ghidra RE in the companion repository
[th06-re]. This repo is updated nightly through [`scripts/export_ghidra_database.py`],
and its history matches the checkin history from our team's Ghidra Server.

If you wish to help us in our Reverse Engineering effort, please contact
@roblabla on discord so we can give you an account on the Ghidra Server.

# Credits

We would like to extend our thanks to the following individuals for their
invaluable contributions:

- @EstexNT for porting the [`var_order` pragma](scripts/pragma_var_order.cpp) to
  MSVC7.
